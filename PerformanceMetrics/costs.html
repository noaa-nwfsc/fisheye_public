        <h3>Fishing gear</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fishing gear is a major fixed cost incurred by vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request fishing gear costs for fishing gear used in both U.S. West Coast, Alaska, and other fisheries, and fishing gear used only on the U.S. West Coast. In the context of the EDC Program, fishing gear includes the purchases of nets, doors, traps, pots, cables, and fishing machinery used in U.S. West Coast fisheries, as well as repairs or
            maintenance of the fishing gear. Fishing gear that is only used in Alaska is not requested.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Fisheye reports one metric for fishing gear expenses. Fishing gear used in all fisheries and fishing gear used only on the U.S. West Coast are added together after costs are allocated to individual fisheries based on the proportion of revenue in each fishery, annually.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Some vessels do not track fishing gear expenses separately from vessel and on-board equipment costs; therefore, this metric may underestimate fishing gear costs. Fishing gear expenses are different from other costs like fuel or safety equipment, which are likely used for all vessel activities, as fishing gear is likely purchased for a single specific fishery. Data are not available at the fishery level, so costs are allocated proportionally across fisheries. This does result in a misallocation of costs associated with fishery-specific gear.

        <h3>On-board equipment</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Vessel and on-board equipment is a major fixed cost incurred by vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request vessel and on-board equipment costs used in U.S. West Coast, Alaska, and other fisheries. In the context of the EDC Program, vessel and on-board equipment costs include the purchases of electronics, safety equipment, and machinery not used to harvest or process fish, as well as major upgrades, repairs, or maintenance to the vessel or equipment.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Respondents do not provide costs broken out by fishery on the EDC forms. The following cost allocation methods are used to report costs by fishery on Fisheye. For catcher vessels, costs are allocated to fisheries according to the annual proportion of ex-vessel revenue in each fishery. For motherships and catcher–processors, a five-year rolling average of total purchases/catch is used to allocate the costs between U.S. West Coast and Alaska fishing operations. The average proportion is used for motherships and catcher–processors because the proportions can vary greatly by year (depending on the TAC) and would result in large artificial swings in the allocation of fixed costs and, indirectly, swings in total cost net revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Some vessels do not track fishing gear expenses separately from vessel and on-board equipment costs, such that those costs are included in equipment costs; therefore, this metric may overestimate vessel and on-board equipment costs. While the EDC form requests that the purchase of a vessel be included in vessel and on-board equipment costs, this metric excludes vessel purchases in order to provide a better per-vessel annual cost estimate. For catcher vessels, processing equipment is also included in on-board equipment. Processing equipment is reported separately for motherships and catcher–processors.

        <h3>Processing equipment</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            For motherships and catcher–processors, processing equipment is a major fixed cost, and is therefore presented separately.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request that motherships and catcher–processors report costs for processing equipment used only on the U.S. West Coast and for equipment shared by U.S. West Coast and all other fisheries. In the context of the EDC forms, processing equipment includes on-board freezers, storage equipment, packing equipment, conveyors, and on-board cargo handling, and does not include equipment, machines, or buildings based primarily on shore. While the EDC forms also request that catcher vessels report any processing equipment used to process or head and gut the fish on board, Processing equipment costs are included in On-board equipment for these vessels because there are so few responses that all of them would be suppressed for confidentiality purposes.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Fisheye reports one metric for processing equipment expenses. Equipment used in all fisheries and equipment used only on the U.S. West Coast are added together after costs are allocated to individual fisheries based on the purchase weight (motherships) or proportion of catch (catcher–processors) on the U.S. West Coast, annually. For motherships and catcher–processors, a five-year rolling average of total purchases/catch is used to allocate the costs between U.S. West Coast and Alaska fishing operations. The average proportion is used for motherships and catcher–processors because the proportions can vary greatly by year depending on the TAC and would result in large artificial swings in the allocation of fixed costs and, indirectly, swings in total cost net revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Processing equipment is grouped into vessel and on-board equipment for catcher vessels because so few vessels report that cost category.

        <h2>Other fixed costs (vessels only)</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The Other fixed costs category includes insurance, moorage, and lease of vessel.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Each cost category is requested as a separate field on the EDC form.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Costs are allocated to each fishery according to the proportion of revenue in each fishery. Once allocated, the costs are summed for each vessel before calculating performance metric statistics.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Insurance and moorage are paid by almost all vessels; lease costs are rare.

        <h2>Shorebased processing-related fixed costs</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Buildings, Equipment, Other fixed costs
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fixed costs incurred by processors do not vary with the level of fish production at facilities and generally include items such as plant facility costs and processing equipment.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms collect information on fixed costs associated with operating a shorebased processor, and each cost category is requested as a separate field. This includes capitalized expenditures on buildings, machinery, and equipment, as well as annual expenses on rental and lease payments and repair and maintenance. Only equipment used to process, transport, or store fish onsite should be included. Processing equipment is defined as all equipment present at this physical location that is used for preparation or packaging of seafood to render it suitable for human consumption, retail sale, industrial uses, or long-term storage, including, but not limited to, cooking, canning, smoking, salting, drying, filleting, freezing, or rendering into meal or oil. Transportation equipment is defined as equipment such as trucks, forklifts, etc., used to transport seafood within the physical location. Storage equipment is defined as equipment present at the physical location for packaging and freezing seafood. Annual expenses on insurance payments are also included in fixed costs.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are reported to summarize fixed costs incurred by shorebased processors:
            <li><b>Buildings:</b>
                Capitalized expenditures on buildings (excluding land but including building improvements), and rental or lease of buildings, job-site trailers, and other structures (including land).
            </li>
            <li><b>Equipment:</b>
                Capitalized expenditures on new and used machinery and equipment, and rental or lease of processing machinery or equipment.
            </li>
            <li><b>Other fixed costs:</b>
                Total expenses on repair and maintenance of facility buildings, machinery, and equipment, and insurance payments (including property, product, personal liability, and fire liability).
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>All fixed costs are allocated to production activity according to the value added for that species group. Not all processors incur expenses for each cost category listed on the EDC form. Only nonzero values are included in summary statistics, and the number of responses indicates the number of processors with nonzero, non-NA values. Number of processors indicates all processors that meet the criterion for a given set of filters.</p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        The EDC forms do not collect information about financing costs of large purchases and investments, but instead collect the capitalized expenditures or total costs associated with the purchases, repair, maintenance, or improvements. For example, if new equipment is purchased, the total cost of the equipment is reported even though the actual cash outlay, if it were financed, would only be the principal and interest payments. It is likely that many larger capital costs, and perhaps some operating costs, are financed. This would mean that the actual cash outlays in a particular year for those items would be less than what is reported on Fisheye and used in the context of the EDC Program.

    <h2>Variable costs</h2>

    <a href = "#costslabor"></a>
    <div id = "costslabor">
        <h3>Labor</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Report the total cost to fishing and processing operations for labor.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the total compensation to individuals on vessels or at shorebased processors. Each sector reports on two categories of compensation, but the categories vary by sector. The two categories for catcher vessels are crew and captain, whereas the categories for motherships, catcher–processors, and shorebased processors are processing and non-processing workers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The two compensation categories are added together to report total labor costs for each sector. The metrics included in Labor Metrics provide more detailed information about the individual labor categories. Processor labor costs are allocated to production activity according to the value added for that species group.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            All catcher vessels in the catch share program use a crew share system to calculate wages (Steiner et al. 2019). The typical share system is based on a contract where wage is calculated as “crew share net revenue” times the crew share percentage (typically 10–15% per crew member). Crew share net revenue is the ex-vessel revenue received by the vessel minus certain costs. Just as with all other cost categories, EDC participants report total crew wages. In order to report fishery-level wages, total wages are allocated to fisheries by calculating the proportion of “crew share net revenue” in each fishery. Some motherships and catcher–processors use a crew share system, but shorebased processors have never reported using any sort of revenue share system.

    <a href = "#costsfishpurchases"></a>
    <div id = "costsfishpurchases">
        <h3>Fish purchases</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fish purchases are the single highest variable cost incurred by motherships and shorebased processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request the total cost of fish purchases by species, which for motherships includes only Pacific whiting. The list of species available for shorebased processors can be found in Fishery and Production Activity Designations.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Cost of fish purchases is reported by species group and source for shorebased processors (Pacific whiting for motherships). Sources include both vessels as well as non-vessel sources like other processors, first receivers, wholesale dealers, or aquaculture producers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Although mothership vessels bring non-whiting species on board, the volume is very low and only whiting costs are reported on the EDC forms.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#costsfuel"></a>
    <div id = "costsfuel">
        <h3>Fuel</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fuel is always one of the three highest variable costs incurred by vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request vessels to report fuel and lubrication costs for all activities on the U.S. West Coast. Vessels are instructed not to include fuel costs for steaming between the U.S. West Coast and Alaska.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Fuel and lubrication costs for catcher vessels are reported by fishery, and for all U.S. West Coast activities combined for motherships and catcher–processors. Unlike other metrics that use days, revenue, or landings to allocate costs, fuel and lubrication costs are allocated by total gallons used per fishery. Gallons are calculated by multiplying the average fuel use per day by fishery and days at sea by fishery for each vessel. See the metric descriptions for Days at sea and Fuel use per day in Other Metrics for more information.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Changes in fuel costs are the result of fishing conditions, fishing locations, technological change, and global fuel prices.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#costspbservers"></a>
    <div id = "costsobservers">
        <h3>Observers/Electronic monitoring</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The catch share program requires 100% observer coverage for all at-sea and shorebased catcher vessels (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.4.2(a)(2)). While motherships and catcher–processors have had 100% (or near-100%) coverage since the mid-1970s, catcher vessels had only 14–24% coverage beginning in 2001, until transitioning to 100% with the catch share program (Somers et al. 2017b). To reduce the immediate burden of this cost on industry, NMFS subsidized daily observer coverage fees for catcher vessels; the subsidy gradually decreased from $330 to $0 between 2011 and 2016 (Warlick et al. 2018). Costs such as observer coverage fees, which were introduced with catch shares, were expected to contribute to consolidation and a decrease in profits (Lian et al. 2009). In response to concerns about the cost to industry for observer coverage, electronic monitoring (EM) was introduced as an alternative to observer coverage for catcher vessels. Observer costs are presented to track this new cost in the fishery, particularly per dollar revenue and per day.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC form requests that vessels report observer and/or EM costs associated with fishing on the U.S. West Coast.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            This metric captures both observer and EM costs. Both costs are allocated to fishery by the proportion of days at sea in each fishery. Other U.S. West Coast fisheries do not require observers, and are therefore not allocated observer costs.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Electronic monitoring was piloted through the Exempted Fishing Permit (EFP) program beginning in 2015. 34% of shorebased whiting vessels used EM in 2015, and 42% in 2016 (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.4.2(a)(2)). In 2019, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) recommended that EM be an option for all midwater trawl vessels in the Pacific whiting fishery and for fixed gear vessels in the Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) fishery beginning in 2021. In 2020, PFMC requested a one-year delay in implementation to develop a mechanism for industry to fund the program. EM fees are structured differently than observer fees. As of 2020, vessels are typically charged a daily rate for observers, whereas for EM there is an initial installation fee, and annual service contracts for technical support and ongoing maintenance estimated at $5,000–$6,000—though some vessels may buy the equipment outright. Additionally, some vessels initially received grants from the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission for EM hardware procurement, which brought the total and averages down as those costs were not reported to the EDC Program. We are unable to report observer and EM costs separately due to confidentiality issues.

    <a href = "#costsmonitoring"></a>
    <div id = "costsmonitoring">
        <h3>Shoreside monitoring</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Just as vessels are required to host observers or use electronic monitoring, the catch share program requires 100% catch monitoring coverage, such that shorebased buyers must have a catch monitor to buy fish caught as part of the catch share program (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.4.2(a)(2)). To reduce the immediate burden of this cost on industry, NMFS subsidized the cost of catch monitors at $41/hr with a maximum of $328/day in 2011 and 2012. This subsidy decreased to $27/hr and $216/day in 2014, and $108/day in 2015. From 2016 onward, first receivers have been required to pay the full cost of monitoring.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC form asks processors to report annual total expenditures on catch monitors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Monitoring costs are allocated to production activity (Pacific whiting or non-whiting groundfish production) by fish purchase weight. Receipt of other species does not require catch monitoring; therefore, no monitoring costs are allocated to other species production.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            There are nonzero values of shoreside monitoring costs prior to catch shares for Pacific whiting activities. In 2009 and 2010, all deliveries of Pacific whiting to a shorebased first receiver were verified by catch monitors, funded entirely by industry.

    <a href = "#costsbuyback"></a>
    <div id = "costsbuyback">
        <h3>Buyback fees</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            In 2003, 91 vessels fishing in the U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery were purchased through a buyback program to reduce capacity in the fishery. The buyback was financed through a government loan, which continues to be paid back by a 4–5% landings fee on groundfish caught in the catch share program (Holland et al. 2017). Landings fees for crab and shrimp were also initiated to pay for the purchase of crab and shrimp permits associated with the buyback vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Buyback fees are calculated using ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Buyback fees are calculated as a percentage of ex-vessel revenue. Table 3 describes buyback fees by year, state, and fishery group. Each fishery was allocated a share of the initial loan amount. Once the fishery has repaid its portion, the buyback fee is reduced to zero.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Each sector was responsible for paying back a certain portion of the original loan. Dashes in the table above indicate when the loan portion was repaid.

    <div id = "costscr">
        <h3>Cost recovery fees</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Cost recovery fees are a new cost associated with the transition to catch share management. In 2014, NOAA Fisheries initiated the collection of cost recovery fees—not to exceed 3% of ex-vessel revenue in a given year—from all shorebased and at-sea participants in the catch share fishery, as required under the MSA (Warlick et al. 2018).
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Cost recovery fees are calculated using ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN. Cost recovery rates are determined annually and published in the Federal Register.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Cost recovery fees are calculated as a percentage of ex-vessel revenue. According to the Federal Register, cost recovery fees range from 2.88% to 3.00% for shoreside landings; 0% to 2.50% for motherships; and 0% to 1.10% for catcher–processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            There are many years when catcher–processors and catcher vessels in the mothership fishery are not required to pay cost recovery fees because the fees collected in a previous year exceeded the direct program costs for the year of the collection.

            Additives, Electricity, Freight and trucking, Gas, Offloading, Offsite freezing and storage, Packing materials, Production supplies, Taxes, Waste and byproduct disposal, Water, Other variable costs.
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Variable costs incurred by processors vary with the level of fish production at facilities, and generally include items such as production and cleaning supplies, additives, and utilities. Labor, fish purchases, and shoreside monitoring costs are also variable costs collected on the EDC form; they are described separately, under the metrics Labor, Fish purchases, and Shoreside monitoring.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms collect information on variable costs associated with operating a shorebased processor. Each cost category is requested as a separate field, although some cost categories are combined for reporting. In general, the EDC forms aim to collect costs that are directly related to facility maintenance and processing operations and not costs that are related to activities or equipment beyond the facility (one exception is Offsite freezing and storage).
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics summarize variable costs incurred by shorebased processors:
            <li><b>Additives:</b>
                Expenses on additives and non-fish ingredients. Additive costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Electricity:</b>
                Utility expenses on electricity. Electricity costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Freight and trucking:</b>
                This metric combines two cost categories on the EDC form: freight costs for supplies (excluding fish) delivered to the facility, and trucking of fish to the facility. Freight and trucking costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group. Outbound freight and trucking costs are not included on the EDC forms.
            </li>
            <li><b>Gas:</b>
                This metric combines three cost categories on the form: natural gas, propane gas for transportation and processing, and other gas (not gasoline). Natural gas costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group. Propane gas costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group. Other gas costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish output weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Offloading:</b>
                Offloading expenses paid to other facilities for their services. Offloading costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Offsite freezing and storage:</b>
                Expenses on offsite product freezing and storage. It is the only cost category related to activities beyond the facility. Offsite freezing and storage costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.

            <li><b>Packing materials:</b>
                Expenses on packing materials. Packing material costs are allocated to production activity proportional to to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Production supplies:</b>
                Expenses on production supplies, including boots, smocks, hairnets, and knives. Production supply costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Taxes:</b>
                Expenses on taxes, including property or excise taxes. Tax costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish output weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Waste and byproduct disposal:</b>
                Expenses on sewer, waste, and byproduct disposal. Waste and byproduct disposal costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Water:</b>
                Utility expenses on water. Water costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Other variable costs:</b>
                This metric combines all remaining variable costs collected on the EDC form, including licensing fees, cleaning and custodial supplies, and communications and office supplies for the facility, which are all allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group. This metric also includes expenses for custom processing of fish owned by a processor that was performed by another processor outside of this facility, which are collected separately for each production activity and therefore are already allocated.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>Not all processors incur expenses for each cost category listed on the EDC form. Only nonzero values are included in summary statistics, and the number of responses indicates the number of processors with nonzero, non-n/a values. The number of processors indicates all processors that meet the criterion for a given set of filters.</p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Not all cost categories have been present on the EDC form from 2009 to present, as cost categories have been amended and expanded over the years.

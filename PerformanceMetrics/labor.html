    <h2>Number of positions</h2>

    <a href = "#labornumber"></a>
    <div id = "labornumber">
        <h3>Number of positions and position-days</h3>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Number of crew, Number of processing crew, Number of non-processing crew, Number of crew-days, Number of processing crew-days, Number of non-processing crew-days
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Catch share programs are expected to reduce the number of vessels in the fishery, resulting in less effort and fewer jobs. The total number of crew is reported to monitor these expected impacts, and the number of 
            crew-days provides a measure of effort (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(a)(3)).
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request the number of days fishing and number of crew positions (crew) by fishery for catcher vessels. Catcher–processors and motherships are required to report the average number of processing crew members 
            and non-processing crew members when operating in the U.S. West Coast whiting fishery. Processing crew includes: line workers, fishmeal crew, quality control, technicians, cleanup, factory managers, mechanics who work 
            on processing equipment, and combis. Non-processing crew includes: captain, deckhands, wheelhouse, galley, and engine room. Catcher–processors and motherships are also required to report the number of days for offloading, 
            steaming, fishing, and/or processing on the U.S. West Coast, steaming between the U.S. West Coast and Alaska, and days at sea for all Alaska fisheries.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For catcher vessels, the number of crew and crew-days are reported by fishery. For catcher–processors and motherships, we report the number of non-processing and processing crew and crew-days. Crew-days are calculated by 
            multiplying the number of crew for a specific fishery by the number of days fished in that fishery. Data are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median) and fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The number of crew is a lower-bound estimate of the number of individuals employed as crew. As reported here, it represents the number of positions on the vessel, excluding captain, and does not take into account turnover or 
            multiple individuals that may fill one position.

        <h2>Number of shorebased processor employees</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Number of non-production employees, Average monthly number of production employees, Maximum monthly number of production employees.
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Monitoring the number of employees at shorebased processors provides information about the number of processing jobs (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(a)(D)).
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the number of production and non-production employees. This information includes full and part-time employees, contract workers, and temporary employees. A production employee is 
            defined as a worker (up through and including the line supervisor level) engaged in fabricating, processing, assembling, inspecting, receiving, packing, warehousing, shipping, maintenance, repair, janitorial, product development, 
            or transporting product on-site. A non-production employee is defined as one involved in supervision above the line supervisor level as well as sales, advertising, credit, collection, installation, cafeteria, recordkeeping, 
            clerical and routine office functions, guard services, executive, purchasing, finance, and legal. For production employees, the EDC form collects the number of production employees and total hours worked for the week that 
            contains the 12th of each month, to capture a weekly snapshot of employment that is assumed to be representative for each month throughout the year. For non-production employees, the EDC form asks for the number of employees 
            and total hours worked for the week that includes 12 March, as non-production employment is assumed to be relatively stable throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are reported for shorebased processor employee numbers:
            <li><b>Number of non-production employees:</b> Number of non-production employees the week of 12 March, assumed to be representative of the year. This metric is reported for the average processor (mean and median) 
                and for the sector as a whole (total).</li>
            <li><b>Average monthly number of production employees:</b>For each processor, the mean of the number of production workers in each month (as represented by the week of the 12th of each month) is calculated. Data are summarized as processor averages (mean and median) and sectorwide totals. 
                The total represents a sum of the workers employed in an average month across the year for all processors.</li>
            <li><b>Maximum monthly number of production employees:</b>For each processor, the maximum number of production workers of all months (as represented by the week of the 12th of each month) is calculated. Data are summarized as processor averages (mean and median). The total is not calculated.</li>
            </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            There are several limitations to the methods. Given that the data are collected for specific weeks of the year, it may be that a given week is not representative of labor throughout the month and/or year. The number of employees is 
            a lower-bound estimate of the number of individuals employed at processing facilities. As reported here, it represents the number of positions, and does not take into account turnover or multiple individuals that may fill one position 
            over the year. For the sector total average monthly number of production employees, the total is a sum of the number of employees in an average month for each processor; therefore, it may not represent the actual total number of production 
            employees working at any point in the year. If companies have a wide range of employment across months due to seasonality, the average may not be representative of any specific month.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            These metrics are only reported for the production activity All production, as information on number of employees is not requested by species group on the processor EDC form given the potential difficulty of such reporting.

    <h2>Compensation</h2>

    <a href = "#laborpayments"></a>
    <div id = "laborpayments">
        <h3>Labor payments</h3>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Crew payments, Processing crew payments, Non-processing crew payments, Production employee payments, Non-production employee payments</p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Labor is one of the highest variable costs incurred by fishing and processing operations. Cost Metrics reports on total labor payments, whereas the labor payments metrics provide total payments made by labor category.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about compensation to individuals on vessels or at shorebased processors. See Number of positions and position-days for full description of the individual labor categories. See the table at the top of this section for a list of which labor categories apply to which sectors. Labor payments include wages, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, and unemployment insurance.
        </p>  
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Labor payments are summarized as reported on the EDC form: crew and captain payments are reported for catcher vessels; processing crew and non-processing crew are reported for motherships and catcher–processors; production employees and non-production employees are reported for processors. Data are reported as vessel/processor averages (mean and median) and fleetwide/sectorwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Crew/employee payments represent total crew/employee payments, whereas wage rates (as described below) summarize compensation per crewmember/employee.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            Shorebased processor production employee payments and non-production employee payments are only reported for the production activity All production.

        <h3>Shorebased processor employee wage rates</h3>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Hourly compensation per production employee, Annual compensation per non-production employee
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            To understand processing employee compensation, it is helpful to summarize overall compensation per unit. These metrics provide estimates of compensation per employee for both production and non-production employees of shorebased processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the number of production and non-production employees and hours worked, as well as total annual labor expenses by type of employee. For production employees, the EDC form collects the number of production workers and total hours worked for the week that contains the 12th of each month, to capture a snapshot of weekly employment. The week that contains the 12th of each month is assumed to be representative of each week in a given month throughout the year. For non-production employees, the EDC form asks for the number of employees and total hours worked for the week that includes the 12th of March, as non-production employment is assumed to be relatively stable throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are reported to summarize compensation and wage rates for shorebased processor employees:
            <li><b>Hourly compensation per production employee:</b>
                Average hourly compensation for production workers is calculated by dividing annual labor expenses by an estimate of total annual hours worked. Estimates of total annual hours worked for each processor are calculated by assuming that employment information for the week of the 12th is representative of the entire month, and by weighting each month equally using the formula below. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median). Total statistics are also reported, and represent weighted averages.
            </li>
            <li><b>Annual compensation per non-production employee:</b>
                Compensation per non-production employee position is calculated by dividing annual labor expenses by the number of non-production employees in the week containing 12 March, assumed to be representative of the number of positions in all weeks during the year. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median); total statistics are not reported.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            To measure annual hours worked, the form asks for the total hours worked by production employees within one week (the week of the 12th) for each month in the year. There are some limitations to this approach, as the given week may not be representative of labor throughout the month. Additionally, each employee is assumed to be compensated equally where, in reality, wage rates may differ by employee. The EDC survey asks for total compensation, which includes wages, bonuses, benefits (including housing), payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and other forms of compensation; therefore, the wage rates reported also include these forms of compensation.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            These metrics are only reported for the production activity All production, as information on number of employees and hours worked is not requested by species group on the processor EDC form, given the potential difficulty of such reporting.

    <a href = "#laborrate"></a>
    <div id = "laborrate">
        <h3>Vessel wage rates</h3>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Captain wage per year, Crew wage per year, Processing crew wage per year, Non-processing crew wage per year, Captain wage per day, Crew wage per day, Processing crew wage per day, Non-processing crew wage per day, Captain wage per dollar revenue, Crew wage per dollar revenue, Processing crew wage per dollar revenue, Non-processing crew wage per dollar revenue
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            To understand captain and crew compensation, it is helpful to summarize overall compensation per unit, e.g., per year, per day, or per dollar of revenue. For instance, crew wage per year is a measure of annual compensation, while crew wage per dollar of revenue is the effective crew share, independent of the share system itself. Crew wage per day provides a standardized rate to compare across operations, because vessels do not operate under a typical 2,080-hour work year.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the total compensation to captain and crew, as well as two pieces of information about the crew share system (costs deducted from ex-vessel revenue and share percentage paid to crew and captain) for catcher vessels. The EDC forms also request the number of days fishing and number of crew by fishery for catcher vessels, and total days spent fishing, steaming, and processing in the U.S. West Coast fishery for motherships and catcher–processors. Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish ticket data maintained by PacFIN; at-sea revenue and production value are obtained from the EDC forms. See Number of positions and position-days for full description of the individual labor categories.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For catcher vessels, the following methods are used for captain and crew, and for catcher–processors and motherships the same methods are applied to both processing and non-processing crew.
            <li><b>Wage per year:</b>
                Total compensation/number of positions.
            </li>
            <li><b>Wage per day:</b>
                Wage per year/number of days fishing.
            </li>
            <li><b>Wage per dollar revenue:</b>
                Wage per year/ex-vessel revenue.
            </li>
            Crew rates are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median). Total statistics are also reported, and represent weighted averages. For example, total crew wage per day is calculated as the sum of crew wages for all vessels divided by the sum of days at sea for all vessels.
            
            <p>See Cost Metrics for a description of cost allocation for crew and captain wages.</p>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Crew wage statistics are based on the number of crew positions, which is a lower-bound estimate for the actual number of individuals employed and does not account for turnover. Each crewmember is assumed to be compensated equally. This is also a limitation, because we expect crew with more experience to be paid more. The measure of wage per day likely overestimates the wage per unit effort, because the time spent in shorebased activities such as vessel repairs or bait preparation is not included in the denominator. Lastly, annual crew compensation does not necessarily reflect the total personal income for a given crew member, who may fish on additional vessels or have non-fishing employment.

        <h3>Processing wage per value-added</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            This metric measures return on employee compensation by calculating the proportion of earnings from fish sales that is used to compensate production employees. This demonstrates how the economic inputs of labor are converted into processor value-added. This ratio can be used as an indicator of potentially changing profit margins for processors; if value-added rises, but compensation costs rise more, the ratio will rise, which, all other things equal, likely indicates declining processor profit margins. Selling highly processed products that require extensive skilled labor may increase the value-added, but may also require that a greater proportion of the markup be dedicated to employee compensation. When this ratio decreases, it suggests that either the company has increased its value-added without increasing labor costs, or has found a way to be more efficient with labor.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            This metric is calculated using data provided by processors on EDC forms, including total compensation for production employees, total value of fish production, total cost of fish purchases, custom processing expenses paid by a processor, and total revenue earned by custom processing fish owned by other entities.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The numerator of this ratio is total production employee compensation, taken directly from EDC forms. The denominator of the ratio is value-added, which is calculated by subtracting the cost of all fish purchases from the revenue of all fish production, adjusted for custom processing activities. In this calculation, custom processing values are included, as revenue earned for custom processing fish that is owned by other entities would not be possible without the labor that is included in the numerator. Furthermore, any expenses paid to other companies who custom process fish for a processor would result in fish production revenue without labor expenses, so custom processing expenses must be taken into consideration. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median). Total statistics are also reported, and represent weighted averages.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            As mentioned under Number of shorebased processor employees, production employees include employees in a variety of roles, many of which do not directly impact the net value of fish purchases and production.
        </p>

    <h2>Labor productivity</h2>

    <a href = "#laborproductivity"></a>
    <div id = "laborproductivity">
        <h3>Revenue per crew-day</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            This metric is a measure of productivity (in terms of revenue generation) of crew. Productivity is related to economic efficiency and shows how economic inputs are converted to outputs. In this case, we measure labor productivity, where the inputs are the number of crew and days fishing, and the output is ex-vessel revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request the number of days fishing and number of crew by fishery. Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN, and Alaska/at-sea revenue and production value from the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            This metric is calculated by dividing ex-vessel revenue by the number of crew-days; where crew-days are calculated by multiplying the number of crew for a specific fishery by the number of days fished in that fishery. This metric is reported as vessel averages (mean and median), as well as fleetwide totals. Total revenue per crew-day is a weighted average, and is calculated as total revenue across all vessels divided by total number of crew-days across all vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            This metric should be interpreted as labor productivity in terms of revenue generation, and not productivity in general or total factor productivity. Other measures of productivity would involve additional inputs and outputs.

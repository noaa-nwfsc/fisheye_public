    <div id = "econrevenue">
        <h2>Revenue</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            This metric captures changes in total harvest volume and ex-vessel prices, as well as changes in total production volume and value for at-sea and shorebased processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN, and Alaska revenue, at-sea ex-vessel revenue, and production value from the EDC forms. EDC forms require shorebased processors to report revenue from seafood sales (by species group and product type) as well as revenue from offloading, custom processing, and insurance settlements. EDC forms for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors include production revenue by product type.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Ex-vessel revenue is summarized for catcher vessels for all fisheries they participate in. Total production revenue is summarized for motherships and catcher–processors for production in the whiting fishery. Total revenue is summarized for processors and is also reported for the following components of total revenue:
            <li><b>Seafood sales revenue:</b>
                Total value of fish products that were made or acquired within the survey fiscal year.
            </li>
            <li><b>Offload revenue:</b>
                Earnings received for offloading services for others. Offloading revenue is allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Custom processing and other revenue:</b>
                Earnings received for custom processing of fish owned by another processor outside of the facility or received for activities besides seafood sales or offloading, such as ice sales. Revenue from custom processing is collected separately for each production activity and therefore is already allocated. Other revenue is allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight for the associated species group.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>Not all processors receive earnings from each revenue source listed on the EDC form. Only nonzero values are included in summary statistics, and the number of responses indicates the number of processors with nonzero, non-n/a values. The number of processors indicates all processors that meet the criterion for a given set of filters.</p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Fishing revenue and seafood sales represent the majority of revenue for catcher vessels, and motherships and catcher–processors, respectively; however, vessels may also generate revenue from other sources, such as the sale and lease of quota, chartering, or insurance settlements. Currently, other sources of revenue for vessels are not included here. For processors, the EDC form also provides a field to write in any other revenue not specified on the form; however, for analytical consistency across processors, that revenue is not included here. Not all revenue categories have been present on the processor EDC form from 2009 to present, as revenue categories have expanded over the years.

    <a href = "#econcosts"></a>
    <div id = "econcosts">
        <h2>Variable costs and fixed costs</h2>
        <p>Variable costs include fuel, observers, shoreside monitoring costs, fish purchases, and other expenses that vary with activity. Fixed costs include fishing gear, on-board equipment, processing equipment, and other expenses that are incurred independent of the level of activity. These summary cost categories are used to calculate variable cost net revenue and total cost net revenue. They are reported in this section for context; see Cost Metrics for more details about the types of costs that are included.
        </p>

    <a href = "#econvcnr"></a>
    <div id = "econvcnr">
        <h2>Variable cost net revenue</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Variable cost net revenue (VCNR) is a measure of the operating profit of the average vessel or processor, and is one of the measures used to summarize net economic benefits of the catch share program.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            As described above, revenue data are obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN for catcher vessels, while seafood production, other revenue, and variable costs data are obtained from EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            VCNR is calculated as revenue minus variable costs, and summarized as vessel (or processor) averages or fleetwide (or sectorwide) rates.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The EDC forms do not capture all costs, so VCNR should be considered an “upper bound.” Quota costs and earnings are not included in the calculation. For processors, the EDC form also provides a field to write in any other costs or revenues not specified on the form; however, for analytical consistency across processors, these are not included here.
        </p>

    <div id = "econtcnr">
        <h2>Total cost net revenue</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            When measured over many years, total cost net revenue (TCNR) is an indication of long-term profitability, and is one of the measures used to summarize net economic benefits of the catch share program. There may be year-to-year fluctuations in TCNR related to unusually high fixed costs (such as a new engine).
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            As described above, revenue data are obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN for catcher vessels, while seafood production, other revenue, and fixed and variable costs data are obtained from EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            TCNR is calculated as revenue minus variable and fixed costs, and summarized as vessel (or processor) averages or fleetwide (or sectorwide) rates.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The EDC forms do not capture all costs, so TCNR should be considered an “upper bound.” Quota costs and earnings are not included in the calculation. For processors, the EDC form also provides a field to write in any other costs or revenues not specified on the form; however, for analytical consistency across processors, these are not included here.
